This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a callback function that attempts to modify state directly within the callback. This is against React's principles of immutability.  Instead, you should use the `setState` function to update the state.  Another aspect is improper cleanup of the effect, leading to unexpected behavior when the component unmounts or updates. For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Incorrect: Directly modifying state
    count = count + 1; // This will not trigger a re-render
  }, []);

  return <Text>{count}</Text>;
};
```
